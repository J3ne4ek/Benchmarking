3. **Intelligent Code Assistance**: JetBrains products provide intelligent code assistance with features like smart code completion, on-the-fly error detection, and quick-fixes. While VS Code also offers these features, the implementation in JetBrains IDEs is often more sophisticated.

4. **Built-in Tools and Features**: JetBrains IDEs come with a wide range of built-in tools and features, such as version control integration, database tools, profilers, debuggers, and test runners. While VS Code has extensions for many of these, JetBrains often provides a more seamless and integrated experience.

5. **Cross-Platform and Cross-Language Support**: Many JetBrains products support multiple languages and platforms out of the box. This can be beneficial for polyglot developers or teams working on multi-language projects.

6. **Professional Support and Regular Updates**: JetBrains offers professional support for their products. They also have a regular update cycle, ensuring that their IDEs stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends.

7. **Ergonomics and Productivity**: JetBrains IDEs are known for their focus on developer ergonomics and productivity. They offer many keyboard shortcuts and intuitive navigation features designed to minimize context switching and keep developers in the flow.

8. **Plugins and Customization**: JetBrains IDEs have a rich ecosystem of plugins that can extend their functionality. They also offer a high degree of customization, allowing developers to tailor the IDE to their specific needs and preferences.

However, it's important to note that VS Code also has its own strengths, such as its lightweight and fast nature, extensive extension marketplace, and strong support for web development and JavaScript. The choice between the two often comes down to personal preference, specific project requirements, and budget.
